## Problem Statement
An e-commerce company wants to understand the relationship between product cost and sales on different e-commerce sites. They want to know if the product cost has a significant impact on sales and if there is any variation in the relationship between product cost and sales across different e-commerce sites. 
 
## Task  
Conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the relationship between product cost and sales on different e-commerce sites. Perform a machine learning algorithm to determine the impact of product cost on sales and examine the relationship between product cost and sales for each e-commerce site separately. 
  
## Data  
You can use this dataset for this exercise:

### Suggested Steps
1. EDA: Analyse the data using visualization. Prepare at least 3 charts that can show insight into the dataset. 
3. Statistical analysis: Apply appropriate hypothesis testing methods to determine statistical  relationships between product, amount, product categories, product size, order status, and e-commerce  
platform. 
4. Machine Learning: Apply appropriate machine learning algorithmss to build a model that predicts sales based on product quantity and e-commerce platform. 
5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics and optimize the result if necessary. 
 
## Deliverable: 
1. A report that summarizes the findings of the analysis, including a graphical representation of the relationship between product cost and sales for each e-commerce site, and a conclusion that highlights the key insights and recommendations for the e-commerce company. (one to two pages)
2. A notebook showing each and every step of the analysis with proper markdowns that makes it easy for the evaluator to understand the notebook
